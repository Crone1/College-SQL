# MySQL
This repository contains all of the code I created in the Databases module which focused on the structured query language SQL. This module taught me to proramme in SQL, teaching me the fundamentals of this language and how to query databases.

We covered all aspects of SQL including, selecting different information, aggregating data, grouping by certain columns, joining different tables, filtering using where clauses and doing nested queires.

This repostiory contains the labs that I completed over the course of this module and the queries I developed within each lab session. For this lab work, I used MySQL Workbench to run my queiries. These queries were based upon the Sakila DVD rental sample databse, the sample Employees database and Classic Models sample database that MySQL offers.
