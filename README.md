# Overview
This repository contains SQL code relating to excercises I completed during my time learning the structured query language *SQL*.
The SQL syntax that these queries follow is _mysql_ as these were written using MySQL Workbench.

---
# Data
The completed excercises were based around three sample databases offered by MySQL Workbench, namely:
- Sakila DVD rental database
- Employees database
- Classic Models database

# Folder Breakdown
The files in this repo are divided based on the respective lab session of the module that they were completed in.
Each lab session had a number of queries, revolving around a specific SQL concept, which needed to be run on the above named databases.

### [Lab 2](Lab_02)
This lab focused on the fundamentals of SQL and how to query a database.
These queries include:
- Selecting information from tables
- Aggregating data
- Grouping by columns
- Filtering data using where clauses
- Ordering resulting tables

### [Lab 3](Lab_03)
This lab expanded on the fundamentals and introduced more sophisticated SQL concepts.
These queries include:
- Joining tables
- Nested queires
- Limiting rows in the output table
- Filtering groups using having clauses

### [Lab 4](Lab_04) and [Lab 5](Lab_05)
These labs dived deeper into the above named topics, using them to query the data in greater detail.
These queries are more complicated and solve more convoluted problems.

### [Mock Exam](Mock_Exam)
This was a sample exam given as part of the module and covered a selection of problems one would expect to encounter when querying a database.
These excercises range from easier to more complicated and also include:
- Adding new records to a table
